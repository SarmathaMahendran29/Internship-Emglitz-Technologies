#  Heart Disease Prediction using Python

###  Internship Project – Emglitz Technologies  
*Duration:* 15 Days  
*Domain:* Python (Machine Learning)

---

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on clinical data such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and other parameters.  
It uses Python and machine learning techniques to analyze health data and predict risk levels.

---

##  Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

---

##  Implementation Steps
1. *Data Collection:* Used the Heart Disease dataset (heart.csv).  
2. *Data Preprocessing:* Handled missing values and standardized data.  
3. *Model Building:* Applied algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.  
4. *Model Evaluation:* Checked accuracy, precision, and recall.  
5. *Visualization:* Created various graphs to understand patterns and correlations.  
6. *Prediction:* The model predicts if a person is likely to have heart disease.

##  Example Visualizations
- Chest Pain Type vs Heart Disease  
- Age vs Cholesterol Level  
- Gender vs Heart Disease Count  

---

##  Example Predictions
- A 54-year-old male with high cholesterol and high blood pressure → *High Risk (82%)*  
- A 40-year-old female with normal levels → *Low Risk (10%)*

---

##  Files Included
- heart.csv – Dataset  
- heartdisease.py – Main Machine Learning and Prediction Code   
- visualisation.py – General Visualization file
- visualisation_cp.py – Chest pain–related visualization
